            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that
                use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the
                invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the
                9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.Since the early 1800s,
                programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and
                player pianos.The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce
                different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Measuring programming language popularity</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages. Methods of measuring programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language,[14] the number of books sold and courses teaching the language (this overestimates the importance of newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language (this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL).

                Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications, while some languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in corporate data centers[15] often on large mainframe computers, Fortran in engineering applications, scripting languages in Web development, and C in embedded software. Many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use. New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added, (for example C++ adds object-orientation to C, and Java adds memory management and bytecode to C++, but as a result, loses efficiency and the ability for low-level manipulation).</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">The History of programming languages</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Very early computers, such as Colossus, were programmed without the help of a stored program, by modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls.

                Slightly later, programs could be written in machine language, where the programmer writes each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly. For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory location might consist of 3 numbers: an "opcode" that selects the "add" operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from punched cards, paper tape, magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer. Machine languages were later termed first-generation programming languages.
                
                The next step was development of so-called second-generation programming languages or assembly languages, which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.
                
                The first high-level programming languages, or third-generation programming languages, were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalk√ºl, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.</p>
